          <p>What is the shape of activist philosophy to come in a time swept up in world capitalism, governmentality, and global warming? Oblique strategies of intervention like transgression, slowness, and accelerationism are restricted by their
            own
            reductive sets of assumptions about movement and scale in particular extremes. Withdrawing from Newton’s a priori commitment to the rigid-body, we claim a notion of inertia sensitive to molecular movement. Inertia is the unstable
            tendential
            behaviors of moving, energetic textures; this notion opens speed and slowness onto intensification and dispersion, resistance and transduction, contraction and expansion. </p>

          <p>ITITIT assembles a web of research-creation apparatuses and experiments running transversally to empirical research, process theory, speculative entrepreneurship, and media art practices that propose new interventions and strategies for
            ethico-aesthetic activism in the 21st century.

                      <p>Urban livability and living together are significant problematics in an age of rapid global urbanization. These problematics are especially significant in places like China, where the urban population is expected to reach 900
                        million
                        by mid-century. Urban social life includes an aesthetic dimension comprising sensory experience with crowding, noise, and other elements of ‘indirect’ social interaction. In the Chinese language, one term frequently used to
                        denote
                        this aesthetic sociality is renao, translated literally as ‘hot and noisy’ and denoting a crowded social gathering and space with a lively, bustling quality. The term appears in Chinese texts dating back a millennium, and
                        renao
                        remains a pervasive element of urban public life and popular discourse in contemporary China’s densely-populated cities. Renao as ‘heat and noise’ constitutes what Lefebvre calls a ‘residue’, excluded from logics organizing
                        the
                        production and consumption of objects or the formation of the built environment, yet integral to everyday creative social activity. As such, renao as aesthetic experience offers an alternative to the spectacular consumption
                        increasingly prevalent in post-reform China, as well as possibilities for social disalienation and for recomposition of the urban oeuvre. Bratt's book draws on fieldwork in the city of Tianjin, China to articulate renao as
                        socioaesthetic practice and alternative urbanism.

                  <h7>#1: Haunted by Cybernetics.</h7>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>We are haunted by cybernetics.</p>

                  <p>The notion of the transhuman or the post-human in the sense of the technologically augmented being able to overcome mortal and biological limitations is one which is grounded in the foundations of Wiener’s cybernetics -- that
                    Wiener is, and now *we are* able to short circuit the distinction between living and non-living systems was a powerful shock to “the human as fleshy body”, the aftershock of which is no doubt still being felt today. Wiener
                    radically expands Descartes’ notion of the automata to all organized systems, such that Wiener creates an equivalence conceit which flattens systems of life and so called-non living systems. This enables us to think into
                    possibility technological augmentation of biology, robotic prosthetics, and other such emboldenings of the Vitruvian Man, to name a few more sensational manifestations.</p>

                  <p>So this is one example of what one can do with the classical and now 70 year old idea called cybernetic. People like Von Foerster with second order cybernetics, Luhman, Bateson, MAturana and Varela have of course patched up,
                    revised, and expanded Wiener’s systems thinking to take into account the organization of the organism, and the dynamics social systems more specifically, and to introduce to us the observer (which Niklas has already helped us to
                    understand in new ways via quantum physics and valuation last night).</p>

                  <p>But there’s a ringing in our ears which needles us to suggest that something has been missed, excluded, and overlooked about the world and experience. We’ll hear about some of that this weekend. But also, we ask: what are the are
                    fallacies or reductions of thinking the world as a cybernetics? Cybernetics has produced an IMAGE of systems, and with it has perpetuated control logics which lead us right into Pythagoras’ old snare-- thereby mistaking the model
                    for the copy. This may be a lazy ontology, but that fact is irrelevant to engineering ( I mean this broadly: marketing, social, behavioral economics, social media and network engineering, and so on) Why? Despite cybernetics error
                    in accounting for metastasis in organisms or equilibrium in social systems-- this image of thought *WORKS* in many domains. Wiener may seem outdated and cybernetics seem to have been made obsolete by new systems thinking,
                    cybernetics persists as DAEMONS running underneath the surface (especially social systems).
                  </p>



                  <p>So, What do we do? If we are haunted by Cybernetics. I suggest we must first -- put on our hats as ghost hunters! That we might begin to think of how to exorcise the poltergeists of cybernetics: the daemons of control, feedback,
                    threshold, and steering!
                    So we have tried to assemble a team of ghost hunters with expertise in very different domains seemingly affected by this cybernetic virus.</p>

                  <p>Biology is a realm Phillip Thurtle as a historian of science, who will offer up three theses on regulation and Life -- with a decidedly dark turn to the Gothic in architecture, literature, and of course, rock music. Sarah Choukah
                    will interrogate the aforementioned influential cybernetic metaphors and analogies enabling traffic on both sides of the intersection” between creative practices intersecting computer and biotech cultures. No doubt Thierry’s
                    earlier work on Douglas Engelbart picks up on the cybernetic genealogy. Engelbart (with his Human Intellect Augmentation lab) as well as others at Xerox Parc no doubt played midwife to Weiner’s vision of cybernetics as “extensions
                    of man” with the delivery of modern personal computing at the Mother of all Demos precisely 20 years after Wieners book. Circling back to biology, Thierry’s work on biotechnologies showcase another Niveau of cybernetic protocols
                    at a nano level -- genealogies and histories which will no doubt glimmer through his speculative work on the “End of the Species.”
                  </p>

                  <p>On an orthogonal track, Michael Beech will take us to the depths of the ocean, to explore the co-designing a research infrastructure with a multi-disciplinary group of ocean science researchers for the study of marine ecosystems.
                    He relates for us what speculation in design and more specifically speculation as a design methodology.
                  </p>


                  <p>Despite Paul Pangaro;s objections, I would argue that there is a clear lineage between cybernetics and the current AI 2.0 craze(!) Look no further, than as Niklas mentioned yesterday, than the State’s new American Artificial
                    Intelligence Initiative! This is due equivalencies between the brain and thought and the human as automata. Sha Xin Wei will speak about this conflation and argue for a richer and more expressive set of practices which also echo
                    Engelbart’s ambitions. Instead of automation replacing all of our jobs, Xin Wei will argue that we need to replace automation with ethico-aesthetic practices of augmentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many of us, cybernetics reeks of psychological behaviorism (not least of which because of Wiener’s appeal to Descartes Automata). And while of it’s an understatement to suggest behaviorism provides an incomplete account of
                    psyche, its conceits about stimulus and response scale to large groups of people via cybernetics, enabling new regimes of biopolitical control instantiated by the very “decentralized networks” we hoped would save us. On the fresh
                    air of poetry and parody, Muindi critiques the cybernetics of self inherent to modern psychotherapy. But does laughter itself perhaps lurk as a biological regulation? Haha.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jon, my associate, adn co-convener, -- the state apparatus to my war machine -- will show us how cultural geographies have inoculated themselves against cybernetics through the discipline’s atavistic enthusiasm for “Humanism” in
                    the 1960s and 1970s seems to have been an appropriate deterrent for the legions of cyberspectres. Driving his “good prognosis” to the hypothetical extreme, I might ask, could “reactionary praxis” be a tactic worth entertaining
                    moving forward?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Desiree talks us to the realm of ecology, of course a concept colonized by cybernetics through the work of Bateson and others. She proposes for us some modes of experience via aesthetics and atmosphere that we might encounter
                    ecology differently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Picking up from Bateson, Nat gives us a test of the groundwater, tracing a genealogy of chemical interventions in agriculture, from the discovery of phosphoric fertilizers by seventeenth century alchemists through the
                    establishment of the global fertilizer industry by nineteenth century organic chemists, will expose continuities in the regulatory logics that allowed “hubris” to become the dominant attitude driving scientific inquiry and
                    commercial ventures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We enter ecology interrupted by cybernetics in the story Harvest, which Josh offers up as an interlocutor for the posthuman.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally Angela will highlight the violence of creating ecological models a la cybernetics and otherwise. Powered by Whitehead, they align organism on the z-axis, disrupting the spatiality of the cybernetic Rudder, ascending
                    upwards towards organization and falling downwards towards chaos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a workshop, Adam and Stacey, with the help of Silvia, will be working with us to distill our reports into a proper brief, a communique, a transmission, which we will share with the rest of the world. You see before you some
                    pens, papers, and so forth. As the meeting progresses, we invite you to use this paper for your own chicken scratch, notations, diagramming, doodling, codes, secrets, and inscriptions. There are also papers hanging out here which
                    we invite you to respond with during breaks or during lunch, or whenever thought strikes. Adam and Stacey will help us to organize these thoughts in a workshop tomorrow!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I too will have a report for you on the very sorry state of sociotechnical systems -- but i have spoken too long already! Let’s get down to business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, we look forward to hearing your reports on the status, vivaciousness, and intensity of the cybernetic haunting in your various areas, and I know we are all eagerly awaiting a discussion about what can be done, and how we can
                    begin to cultivate an alternative approach to organization which wards off the Ghosts in the Machine. Thank you and welcome !
