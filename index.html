                  <p>Garrett Laroy Johnson works with responsive media environments to probe, condition,
engender, and refract relations between technological determinations and productions of
subjectivity. Trained as a musician and musicologist, questions of ensemble, materiality,
expression, learning, gesture, and vocality are central to his research. Johnson designs and creates
digital-physical systems activating sound, light, and expressive materials in immersive and
quotidian spaces alike. His dissertation deals with the study, learning and teaching of computational media arts.</p>
                  
                  <p>Garrett is working on a PhD in <a href = "https://artsmediaengineering.asu.edu/degree-programs/media-arts-and-sciences-phd">Media Arts and Sciences</a> and <a href = "https://english.clas.asu.edu/degrees/grad/critical-theory-grad-certificate">Critical Theory (grad certificate)</a> at Arizona State University supervised by Sha Xin Wei (chair), Lauren Sarah Hayes, and Adam Nocek. Garrett received an MA in musicology from Arizona State University, a B.Music in Music History from Ohio University, and a DAAD award to study musicology at the University of Leipzig.</p>
                  
                  < Johnson has presented research-creation at ACM MOCO, ISEA,
SEAMUS, SLSA and SLSAeu, ACLA, AAG, and has had works performed and exhibited at
Kennedy Center as well as the National Academy of Sciences in DC, in London, San Francisco,
Cincinnati, Irvine, and Phoenix. A significant aspect of his work deals in community building and
organizing, exemplified in varied and far-flung groups such as LORKAS (the laptop orchestra of
arizona state, 2013-2015), PHuN (the post-human network, 2016-present), and ITITIT{inc}
                           (2017-present).</p>

As co-director of PHuN, he has organized two symposiums and two conferences, and facilitates reading groups on campus and over video conferencing with interlocutors from around the country.</p>
                    
                    <p>Garrett creates immersive responsive media environments + installations  interactive dance works, various performances for live electronics, laptop orchestra pieces, and sound-based fixed media. In recent projects, he improvised regularly on laptop with the dark/ambient group <a href="/gulch/index.html">Gulch</a>, and with cello and laptop in the group <a href= "/gbjjck/index.html">gbjjck</a>. He’s worked with artists and performers from many different disciplines, including among others Guillermo Gomez-Peña, Chris Ziegler, Sha Xin Wei, Julian Stein, and Britta Joy Peterson. His music has been invited to SEAMUS, the Oh My Ears! Music Marathon, Interference Series and the ACDA at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and his installations have been featured at the 2013 ASU Microtonal Music Festival, ARTEL PHX, and commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art for <a href = "https://influxaz.com/installation/topo-by-briggs-johnson-and-kautz/">InFlux Cycle 6.</a></p>

Garrett has presented some of his musicological investigations into the the bioregional music of experimental American composer David Dunn and the psycho-dramaturgy of Wolfgang Rihm’s opera Dionysos (2010) at various conferences in the US and Canada. In May of 2015, he organized with <a href = "https://www.matthewjbriggs.com/old-home">Matt Briggs</a> SSOO (something said only once), a four-day arts mini-fest thematizing improvisation, algorithmic creation, indeterminacy, and site-specificity.</p>
                    <p>Garrett led <a href = "thelorkas.weebly.com">LORKAS (The Laptop Orchestra of Arizona State)</a> from Fall 2013 to Spring 2015 as the group’s director.
